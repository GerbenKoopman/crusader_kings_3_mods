# Knight Title Flavorization
# Note: Complex conditional logic (is_knight, is_lowborn, traits, etc.) cannot be implemented
# directly in flavorization files. See scripted_triggers/00_knight_triggers.txt for
# trigger-based knight logic. These flavorizations work based on domicile types and governments.
