# Knight Title Flavorization
# Note: Complex conditional logic (is_knight, is_lowborn, traits, etc.) cannot be implemented
# directly in flavorization files. See scripted_triggers/00_knight_triggers.txt for
# trigger-based knight logic. These flavorizations work based on domicile types and governments.
# Flags are set via on_action (see common/on_action/00_knight_on_actions.txt)
