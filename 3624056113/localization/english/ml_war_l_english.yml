 ml_war.0001.t: "As a Lord: Join the war?"
 ml_war.0001.d: "The news arrives: your liege has mustered their forces, and the distant beat of war drums echoes low and steady, seeming to pierce the morning mist and shake the earth and air. The wind carries the scent of dust and horses, while banners in the distance tremble gently in the pale light. \nA subtle ripple stirs in your heart—will you ride with your liege, fighting for the safety and honor of the land? \nAs a manor lord, every choice you make silently conveys your stance and loyalty."
 ml_war.0001.a: "Of course"
 ml_war.0001.b: "Forget it"
