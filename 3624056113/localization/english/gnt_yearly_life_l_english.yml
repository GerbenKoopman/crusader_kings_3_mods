 gnt_yearly_life.0001.d: "The captain of the guard stepped forward to report, "My lord, these two men struck something hard with their hoes while digging peat by the marsh—a mud-caked metal statuette, about the length of a forearm. It appears to be cast from silver and is inlaid with a few faded stones." \nOld [the_old_farmer.GetShortUIName] dropped to his knees first, his voice hoarse and cracking: "I saw it first! I swear by the Holy Mother! My hoe hit it with a clang that sent a shock straight through my hands!" \nYoung [the_young_farmer.GetShortUIName] flushed with fury, veins bulging on his neck: "I was the one who hauled it out of the mud! This old codger tried to snatch it—we wrestled so hard the statue's scepter got bent!"

 gnt_yearly_life.0002.d: "The afternoon calm is shattered by the clatter of armor. Your loyal knight [firstknight.GetFirstName] enters your hall, accompanied by a dirt-covered, terrified peasant. The peasant nervously twists his hat in his hands, while your knight’s expression is grim. \n“My lord,” the knight begins, “this is [the_reporter.GetShortUIName]. They have encountered trouble. They claim a monster has been prowling near the forest’s edge. It has already carried off two sheep, and last week it even attacked a lone woodcutter…”\n[the_reporter.GetShortUIName] drops to their knees, babbling, “My lord, please… that thing is no ordinary monster. It is terrifyingly large, its eyes glowing like burning coals at night! We dare not leave the village!”\nAll eyes turn toward you."

 gnt_yearly_life.0022.t: "As a Lord: A Monster's Menace?"
 gnt_yearly_life.0022.d: "After days of tracking, following the discovered footprints and the villagers’ sightings, you finally locate the source of the trouble. It is neither a devil nor monster, but a very real brown bear, enormous beyond all expectation. With its back turned to you, it is tearing apart the carcass of a deer with its massive claws, the heavy stench of blood and animal musk rushing toward you.\nThe bear has clearly reached old age, a savage old scar slashing across its left eye, making it appear all the more ferocious. It is larger than any of its kind you have ever seen, the muscles of its shoulders and back rising like stone.\n[firstknight.GetShortUIName] silently draws his sword, expression grim."
 gnt_yearly_life.0022.a: "Let me finish this!"

 gnt_yearly_life.0003.t: "As a Lord: That Silhouette"
 gnt_yearly_life.0003.d: "On an ordinary afternoon, you stepped into the garden seeking a moment of peace. Turning through the rose-covered arch, you caught sight under a nearby pavilion of [randomcourtier.GetFirstName] conversing with a stranger. The two seemed to be enjoying their talk, laughter faintly audible.\nThe stranger stood with their back to you, posture elegant and composed. Simply standing there, they formed, together with the surrounding flowers and light, a pleasingly harmonious scene that made you pause.\nA strange flutter stirred in your heart. It was not merely curiosity, but like suddenly hearing a clear, high note in a dull musical passage, making you eager to know its full melody."
 gnt_yearly_life.0003.a: "[randomcourtier.GetFirstName], have you finished your work?"
 gnt_yearly_life.0003.a.success: "[beauty.GetFirstName] is captivated by your charisma"

 gnt_yearly_life.0003.c: "Forget it, I have better things to do"
 gnt_yearly_life.0031.d: "“Few people can make my garden feel so cramped,” you say, your voice carrying a hint of unmistakable admiration and knowing amusement. “The sunlight here is far too boisterous. Perhaps we can move to a quieter place and get to know each other properly.” [beauty.GetShortUIName]’s lips curl into a subtle, knowing smile, eyes clear yet seeming to hide countless untold stories. “As you wish,” [beauty.GetShortUIName] responds softly.\nIn the idle guest room, the light is gentle, and floating specks of dust shimmer in the serene air. When the doors close, cutting off the outside world, a sense of intimacy quietly spreads. You stand facing each other, close enough to touch, and the tacit understanding from the garden now transforms into a more tangible, more anticipatory tension."
 gnt_yearly_life.0031.a: "I want you! I want you right now!"
 gnt_yearly_life.0031.b: "Shall we meet every day?"
 gnt_yearly_life.0031.c: "This will be a beautiful friendship!"
 gnt_yearly_life.0032.d: "“The weather is really nice! Uh… I mean, these flowers are blooming beautifully. Don’t you think so?” you try to offer a friendly smile. [beauty.GetShortUIName] turns, her gaze calm as it sweeps over you, neither impressed nor curious, as if you were no different from any statue in the garden.\n“You are right.” [beauty.GetShortUIName]’s response is brief, tone flat and even carrying a trace of detachment at being interrupted. [beauty.GetShortUIName] nods slightly, as a matter of courtesy, then her gaze drifts past your shoulder back toward the distant trees, clearly signaling the end of the conversation. That aloofness, keeping you at a thousand miles’ distance, is more complete than any verbal refusal."
 gnt_yearly_life.0032.a: "Alright…"
 gnt_yearly_life.0032.b: "If you suddenly disappeared, no one would care, right?"

 gnt_yearly_life.0004.t: "As a Lord: Passing the Training Grounds"
 gnt_yearly_life.0004.d: "The afternoon sun shone on the hard ground of the manor training grounds. As usual, you walked through the courtyard, but were drawn by the bursts of cheering from the training field. Along the wooden fence, a circle of courtiers and handmaidens had gathered, watching eagerly at the center of the field. In the middle, two knights were dueling. [firstknight.GetFirstName]’s sword strikes were steady and powerful, each block producing a muffled clang; [otherknight.GetFirstName] was as nimble as a wildcat, launching attacks from impossible angles. “Good!” the onlooking courtiers applauded. A handmaiden even tossed a wildflower into the ring.\nAt that moment, [firstknight.GetFirstName] spotted you outside the fence. “My lord!” he shouted, “Care to stretch your limbs together? I promise the wooden swords are blunt!”\nSuddenly, the surroundings fell silent."
 gnt_yearly_life.0004.a: "Shall I give it a try?"

 gnt_yearly_life.0005.t: "As a Lord: The Broken Well"
 gnt_yearly_life.0005.d: "The wooden doors of the hall were pushed open, and a guard brought in two young men. Morning light streamed through the doorway, casting long shadows on the floor.\n“My lord,” the guard saluted and reported, “we caught these two lads last night. They got drunk and went mad by the village communal well, smashing the well’s edge with stones. This morning, when villagers came to draw water, two buckets had already fallen in.” \nTwo young men were pushed to the center of the hall, heads bowed. The guard added, “By the time we arrived, a large portion of the well’s edge was already broken, and the shards were scattered all over the ground. They refused to stop until we restrained them, only then did they sober up."
