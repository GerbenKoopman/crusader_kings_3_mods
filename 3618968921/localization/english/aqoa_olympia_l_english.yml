 #Track
 trait_track_olympia_class_tier:0 "Affluence Rank"
 trait_track_olympia_class_tier_desc:0 "Affluence is a measure of material standing, improved by increasing monthly [income|E] or amassing [gold|E].\n\nAffluence is shared through families and close associates. [spouses|E], [close_family|E], and [best_friends|E] share full Affluence, while [extended_family|E], [wards|E], [hostages|E], and [friends|E] benefit from 75% of that rank. This shared standing is severely diminished for [bastards|E], [concubines|E], and the [disinherited|E]."
 # DESCRIPTIONS
 trait_olympia_class_tier_desc:0 "Access to resources, essentials, and luxuries are all determined by a character's class and wealth."
 #Prisoner
 olympia_class_tier_prisoner_desc:0 "Stone walls and iron bars have replaced [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] usual comforts. Stripped of dignity and agency, [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] has been forced to exchange the privileges of [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] station for the harsh reality of confinement. Here, gold buys neither warmth nor safety."
 
 # Bottom: The "Genteel Poor" / Landless Courtier
 olympia_class_tier_bottom_desc:0 "Though [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] can access the halls of power, [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] purse is undeniably empty. Dependent on the charity of others to maintain a facade of wealth, [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] possesses little more than the threadbare clothes on [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] back and lives in cramped quarters little better than the poor of society."
 
 #Bottom: The Austere Ruler
 olympia_class_tier_bottom_ruler_desc:0 "Though [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] holds the reins of power, [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] coffers are distressingly bare. Unable to maintain [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] holdings or adequately reward loyal servants, [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] rules over a realm as impoverished as its liege. The trappings of authority ring hollow when there is no coin to enforce [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] will."
 
 # Low: The working courtier / Minor Knight
 olympia_class_tier_low_desc:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] means are limited, but sufficient to maintain dignity. While [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] cannot afford true luxuries or imported finery, neither does [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] fear the elements. Frugality is a requirement, not a choice."
 
 # Low-Mid: The established Burgher / Landed Gentry
 olympia_class_tier_low_mid_desc:0 "A life of relative ease. [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] enjoys reliable access to quality goods, personal servants, and respectable quarters. While not wealthy enough to influence great politics with gold alone, [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] lacks for no essential comfort."
 
 # Mid: The Wealthy Noble
 olympia_class_tier_mid_desc:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] coffers are well-stocked and [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] reputation is trusted by lenders. Fine silks, imported wines, and private retinues are the norm. [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe|U] can afford to be generous with the resources at [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] disposal."
 
 # High: The High Lord / Duke
 olympia_class_tier_high_desc:0 "Great wealth flows through [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] hands. [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe|U] is surrounded by a level of luxury that makes lesser nobles envious. From heavy jewelry to grand feasts, cost is rarely an obstacle for [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim]."
 
 # Elite: The King / Emperor / Mansa Musa levels
 olympia_class_tier_elite_desc:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] sits at the pinnacle of material society. With access to vast fortunes, [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] commands resources that rival the treasuries of neighboring kings and emperors. For [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim], the world is not purchased; it is owned."

 # Bottom: Destitute (The Struggling Vagrant)
 landless_olympia_class_tier_bottom_desc:0 "The road is a cruel master to the empty purse. [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] struggles to keep [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] camp fed and equipment serviceable. Scavenging and begging have replaced glory, and every broken wheel or rusted blade threatens to end [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] journey permanently."
 
 # Low: Modest (The Working Mercenary)
 landless_olympia_class_tier_low_desc:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] camp is functional, if sparse. There is no coin for idle luxuries, but the essential supplies for travel and war are accounted for. [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe|U] sleeps on the ground and mends [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] own gear, prioritizing the next meal over a soft bed."
 
 # Low-Mid: Comfortable (The Successful Captain)
 landless_olympia_class_tier_low_mid_desc:0 "A successful journey brings its own rewards. [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] travels with sturdy mounts and watertight tents. While not drowning in gold, [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] can afford decent lodgings in town and reliable provisions, ensuring [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] followers march with full bellies."
 
 # Mid: Prosperous (The Wealthy Commander)
 landless_olympia_class_tier_mid_desc:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] war chest is heavy and [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] credit is good at every tavern and smithy. With a retinue of supply wagons and high-quality steel, [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] lives better on the road than many petty lords do in their castles."
 
 # High: Opulent (The Warlord)
 landless_olympia_class_tier_high_desc:0 "The camp of [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is a moving spectacle of wealth. [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe|U] rests in a grand pavilion furnished with looted silks and purchased finery. [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] company is lavishly equipped, and this display of fortune serves as a warning as much as a boast."
 
 # Elite: Magnificent (The King without a Crown / Golden Company)
 landless_olympia_class_tier_elite_desc:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] commands a moving empire. The wealth transported in [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] train rivals the vaults of static kingdoms. For [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim], the world is not a map of borders, but a series of markets to be bought and battles to be financed without a second thought."
